## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the power of a base raised to a non-negative exponent using a recursive function.  
It demonstrates recursion by reducing the exponent until it reaches zero.

## 📘 Description  
The program flow:  
- Prompts the user to enter a base integer and a non-negative exponent.  
- Validates that the exponent is non-negative.  
- Uses the recursive `power` function which calls itself with the exponent decremented by 1 until it reaches 0, returning 1 as the base case.  
- Computes and displays the result of \( \text{base}^{\text{exponent}} \).

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Recursive function implementation  
- Input validation  
- Basic arithmetic operations and return values  
- User input/output using `scanf()` and `printf()`
