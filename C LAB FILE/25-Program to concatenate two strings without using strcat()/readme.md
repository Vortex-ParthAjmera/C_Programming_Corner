## 📄 Overview  
This C program concatenates two user-input strings without using built-in library functions.  
It reads two strings, removes trailing newlines, and appends the second string to the first.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program performs the following operations:  
- Reads the first and second strings from the user using `fgets()`.  
- Removes trailing newline characters from both strings to ensure clean concatenation.  
- Uses the `concatenateStrings` function to append the second string to the first manually by copying characters.  
- Outputs the concatenated string.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Manual string manipulation without standard library concatenation  
- Handling of newline characters in input strings  
- String traversal and indexing  
- Array manipulation and pointer usage implicitly
