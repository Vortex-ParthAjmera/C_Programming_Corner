## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates swapping two integer values using a function with call by value.  
It shows that the swap inside the function affects only local copies and does not modify the original variables.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a function `swapByValue` that attempts to swap two integers passed by value (copies).  
- The function prints the swapped values inside its scope.  
- The `main` function prints the values before and after calling `swapByValue`, illustrating that original values remain unchanged.  
- Highlights the behavior of call by value where parameters are passed by copying, not by reference.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Call by value parameter passing  
- Function scope vs original variable scope  
- Printing variable states to observe change effects  
- Limitations of call by value for modifying caller variables
