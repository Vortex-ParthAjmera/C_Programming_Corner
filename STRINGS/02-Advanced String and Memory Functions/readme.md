## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates advanced string handling functions, including tokenization, span calculations, memory-safe copying, and overlapping memory moves.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Uses `strdup` to safely duplicate strings (POSIX function).  
- Demonstrates `strspn` and `strcspn` to compute spans of character sets.  
- Finds the first occurrence of any delimiter character with `strpbrk`.  
- Splits a string into tokens using `strtok`.  
- Shows safe memory moving with `memmove` for overlapping memory areas.  
- Optionally demonstrates GNU extensions `stpcpy` and `stpncpy` for efficient string copying (conditional compilation).

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Safe string duplication and memory management  
- Tokenization and delimiter-based parsing  
- Character class span calculations  
- Handling overlapping memory with safe copy  
- Conditional compilation for platform-specific features
