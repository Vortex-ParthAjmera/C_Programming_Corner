## 📄 Overview  
This C program swaps the values of two integers using pointers.  
It demonstrates how to manipulate variables directly through their memory addresses.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program works as follows:  
- Prompts the user to enter two integers.  
- Displays the values before swapping.  
- Calls a `swap` function that uses pointer parameters to exchange the values of the two integers.  
- Displays the values after swapping to confirm the operation.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Use of pointers and pointer dereferencing  
- Function definition and parameter passing by address  
- Basic input/output with `scanf()` and `printf()`
