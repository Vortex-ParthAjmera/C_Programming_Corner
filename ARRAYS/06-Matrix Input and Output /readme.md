## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the number of rows and columns for the matrix.  
- Accepts matrix elements from the user with specific row and column prompts.  
- Prints the matrix in a tabular format preserving its 2D structure.  
- Uses nested loops for input and output traversal of the matrix.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Multidimensional array handling with variable dimensions  
- Nested loops for matrix input and display  
- User interaction with indices display for clarity  
- Basic formatted output using `printf()`
