## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the power of a base raised to a non-negative exponent using recursion.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads base and exponent from the user.  
- Implements a recursive `power` function with the base case of exponent zero.  
- Validates that exponent is non-negative before calculation.  
- Prints the computed power result.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Recursive function with base and recursive cases  
- Input validation  
- Simple mathematical recursion  
- Clean formatted output
