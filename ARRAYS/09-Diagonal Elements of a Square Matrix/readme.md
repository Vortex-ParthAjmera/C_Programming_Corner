## 📄 Overview  
This C program reads a square matrix and prints its primary and secondary diagonal elements.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the size of a square matrix.  
- Accepts matrix elements from the user using nested loops.  
- Prints elements on the primary diagonal (where row index equals column index).  
- Prints elements on the secondary diagonal (where column index is `n - 1 - row index`).  
- Outputs the diagonal elements with space separation.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Square matrix handling with two-dimensional arrays  
- Accessing matrix elements by computed indices  
- Looping constructs for matrix traversal  
- Clear formatted output of specific matrix subsets
