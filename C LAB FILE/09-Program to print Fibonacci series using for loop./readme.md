## 📄 Overview  
This C program prints the Fibonacci series up to the number of terms specified by the user.  
It calculates each term by adding the two preceding terms and displays the sequence starting from 0.

## 📘 Description  
The program executes the following steps:  
- Prompts the user to enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci series.  
- Displays the Fibonacci sequence starting from 0 and 1.  
- Uses a `for` loop to calculate and print each subsequent term by summing the two previous terms.  

Key programming concepts demonstrated include:  
- Loop control using a `for` loop  
- Conditional statements to handle the first two terms separately  
- Variable updates to store the latest two terms of the series  
- User input and output handling with `scanf()` and `printf()`
