## 📄 Overview  
This C program reverses a user-input string in place.  
It reads the string, removes any trailing newline, and swaps characters to reverse it.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program performs the following tasks:  
- Reads a string input from the user using `fgets()`.  
- Removes the newline character if present at the end of the string.  
- Uses the `reverseString` function to reverse the string by swapping characters from the start and end moving towards the center.  
- Prints the reversed string to the console.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- String length calculation using a loop  
- Character swapping for string reversal  
- Handling of newline characters in input  
- Array manipulation and loop constructs
