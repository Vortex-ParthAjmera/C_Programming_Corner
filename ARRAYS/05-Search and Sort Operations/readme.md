## 📄 Overview  
This C program offers three functionalities on integer arrays:  
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search (requires sorted array)  
- Bubble Sort  

Users can input array elements and choose an operation to perform.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the number of elements and input values for the array.  
- Provides a menu for selecting Linear Search, Binary Search, or Bubble Sort.  
- Implements `linearSearch` for sequential search of a key.  
- Implements `binarySearch` for efficient search on a sorted array using divide and conquer.  
- Implements `bubbleSort` to sort the array in ascending order.  
- Displays search results or shows the sorted array after bubble sort.  
- Includes input validation for choices and guides user on requirements (e.g., sorted input for binary search).

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Array handling and manipulation  
- Search algorithms: linear vs binary  
- Sorting algorithm: bubble sort  
- Modular function design  
- User interaction with menus and input validation
