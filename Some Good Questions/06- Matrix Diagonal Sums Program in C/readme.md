## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the sums of both main (primary) and anti (secondary) diagonals of a square matrix.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the size of a square matrix from the user.  
- Accepts all matrix elements using nested loops.  
- Calculates the sum of main diagonal elements (`arr[i][i]` for `i = 0 to n-1`).  
- Calculates the sum of anti-diagonal elements (`arr[i][n-1-i]` for `i = 0 to n-1`).  
- Prints both diagonal sums clearly formatted.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Two-dimensional array input and traversal  
- Index arithmetic for diagonal access  
- Accumulation logic for sums  
- Efficient single-pass diagonal computation
