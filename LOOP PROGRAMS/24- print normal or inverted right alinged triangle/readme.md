## 📄 Overview  
This C program prints either a normal or an inverted triangle pattern made of stars (*) based on the user’s choice.  
It reads the number of rows and pattern choice, then prints the specified pattern using nested loops.

## 📘 Description  
Program workflow:  
- Prompts the user to input the number of rows for the pattern.  
- Provides a menu to select between a normal triangle and an inverted triangle.  
- Uses nested `for` loops to print the chosen star pattern.  
- Displays an error message if the choice is invalid.

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Nested loops for pattern generation  
- Conditional branching with `switch` and `case`  
- User input handling and validation  
- Console output formatting
