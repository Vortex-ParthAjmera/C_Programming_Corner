## 📄 Overview  
This C program counts the number of vowels and consonants in a user-entered string.  
It processes both uppercase and lowercase letters and ignores non-alphabetic characters.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program flow includes:  
- Prompting the user to input a string.  
- Removing a trailing newline character if present.  
- Using the `count_vowels_consonants` function to iterate through the string, counting vowels and consonants by checking character ranges.  
- Printing the counts of vowels and consonants.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Character handling and ASCII value manipulation  
- Pointer usage for returning multiple values  
- String reading with `fgets()` and newline trimming  
- Conditional statements for categorization of characters
