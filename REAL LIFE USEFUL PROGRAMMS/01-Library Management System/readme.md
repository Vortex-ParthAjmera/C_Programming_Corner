## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Stores up to 100 books with ID, title, and availability status.

- Provides a menu-driven interface for all library operations.  
- Ensures data consistency with validation for book IDs and availability.  
- Implements searching with substring matching.  
- Properly manages book borrowing state with clear user prompts and messages.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Structs for composite data management  
- Arrays of structs for collection handling  
- String manipulation and input handling  
- Menu-driven control flow with `switch` statements  
- Validation and error handling
