## 📄 Overview  
This C program reads a string and counts the total number of alphabets, digits, and symbols (special characters) present in it.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads a string using `fgets()` with safe buffer size.  
- Uses an integer array `freq[256]` to track frequency of each ASCII character.  
- Categorizes characters into:  
  - **Alphabets** (A-Z, a-z)  
  - **Digits** (0-9)  
  - **Symbols** (all other non-space, non-newline characters)  
- Prints the count of each category.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Character classification and counting  
- ASCII character array indexing  
- Safe string input with `fgets()`  
- Conditional logic for character categorization
