## 📄 Overview  
This C program checks whether a square matrix is symmetric or not.  
A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the order and elements of a square matrix from the user.  
- Compares each element `(i, j)` with the element `(j, i)` to verify symmetry.  
- Uses nested loops for efficient traversal and comparison.  
- Prints a clear message indicating whether the matrix is symmetric or not.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Two-dimensional array manipulation  
- Nested loop traversal for matrix comparison  
- Logical flag management for condition checking  
- Input/output handling with formatted messages
