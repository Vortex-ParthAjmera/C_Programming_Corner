## 📄 Overview  
This C program reads a matrix of user-defined size and computes its transpose.  
The transpose swaps rows and columns and prints the resulting matrix.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the number of rows and columns for the matrix.  
- Accepts input elements from the user.  
- Computes the transpose by assigning element at `(i, j)` in original to `(j, i)` in transpose matrix.  
- Prints the transposed matrix in formatted tabular form.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Multidimensional array input and manipulation  
- Nested loops for matrix traversal and reassignment  
- Understanding matrix transpose operation  
- Proper formatted output for matrices
