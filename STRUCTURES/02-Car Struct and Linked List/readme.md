## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates advanced struct usage with bit-fields and typedefs, alongside a simple singly linked list implementation.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a `Car` struct with bit-fields for compact storage of year and electric status.  
- Uses typedef to simplify struct usage.  
- Implements a function to display `Car` information passed by value.  
- Defines a self-referencing `Node` struct for singly linked list nodes.  
- Implements functions to create nodes and print the linked list.  
- Demonstrates linked list creation with three nodes and safely frees allocated memory.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Bit-fields in structs for memory-efficient data representation  
- Typedef for cleaner struct declarations  
- Struct passing by value to functions  
- Dynamic memory allocation and linked list operations  
- Proper memory management with free()
