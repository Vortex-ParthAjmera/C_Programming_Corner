## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates a custom recursive function named `crazy` that recursively calls itself with modified parameters before and after printing.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a recursive function `crazy(int n, int a, int b)` that:  
  - Stops recursion when `n` is less than or equal to zero.  
  - Recursively calls itself twice, swapping and modifying parameters in a non-trivial pattern.  
  - Prints the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` during each recursive return phase.  
- Demonstrates recursion with multiple recursive calls and parameter transformations leading to an interesting output sequence.  
- Called initially with inputs `(3, 4, 5)` from `main`.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Complex recursion with multiple calls and swapping parameters  
- Base case and recursive steps in depth-first recursion  
- Recursive call stack behavior and output ordering
