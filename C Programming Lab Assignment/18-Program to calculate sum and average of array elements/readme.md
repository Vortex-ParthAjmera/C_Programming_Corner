## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the sum and average of elements in an integer array input by the user.  
It includes functions to compute the sum and the average with proper handling for empty arrays.

## 📘 Description  
The program workflow includes:  
- Reading the number of elements and validating input.  
- Accepting integer inputs to fill the array, defaulting to zero if input is invalid.  
- Computing the total sum using the `sum_array` function.  
- Computing the average using the `average_array` function that utilizes the sum function.  
- Printing the sum and average (formatted to two decimal places).

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Array handling and iteration  
- Function modularity and reuse  
- Typecasting for average calculation  
- Input validation and formatting output
