## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the sum of the digits of an integer entered by the user.  
It handles both positive and negative numbers by converting negative inputs to their absolute values.

## 📘 Description  
The program follows these steps:  
- Prompts the user to enter an integer number.  
- Converts negative input to positive to handle digit extraction uniformly.  
- Uses a `do-while` loop to extract each digit of the number by using the modulus operator `%`.  
- Sums each extracted digit until the entire number is processed.  
- Displays the resulting sum of digits to the user.

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Handling user input with `scanf()`  
- Processing digits using modulus and division operations  
- Loop control with a `do-while` loop  
- Conditional handling of negative numbers
