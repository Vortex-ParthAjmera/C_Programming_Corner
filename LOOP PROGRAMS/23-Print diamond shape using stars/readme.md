## 📄 Overview  
This C program prints a diamond-shaped pattern of stars (*) based on the number of rows specified by the user.  
It prints the upper and lower halves of the diamond symmetrically using nested loops.

## 📘 Description  
Program operation:  
- Reads the number of rows (height) for the diamond pattern.  
- The upper half: prints spaces followed by stars incrementally to form the top triangle.  
- The lower half: prints spaces followed by stars decrementally to form the inverted bottom triangle.  
- Uses nested `for` loops for space and star printing.

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Nested loops for pattern generation  
- Controlling output formatting with spaces and characters  
- Console output manipulation
