## 📄 Overview  
This C program adds two matrices of user-defined dimensions.  
It reads elements for both matrices, computes their sum, and displays the resulting matrix.

## 📘 Description  
Program functions:  
- `read_matrix`: Reads matrix elements from user input with validation.  
- `add_matrices`: Adds corresponding elements of two matrices to produce a sum matrix.  
- `print_matrix`: Prints the sum matrix in a formatted tabular layout.

The program flow:  
- Accepts the number of rows and columns with input validation.  
- Reads two matrices from the user.  
- Adds the matrices using a function.  
- Prints the summed matrix to the console.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Multidimensional arrays with variable sizes  
- Function use for modular code  
- Input validation  
- Nested loops for matrix operations and formatted output
