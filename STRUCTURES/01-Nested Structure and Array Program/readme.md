## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates the use of nested structures and arrays within structures.  
It defines a `Student` structure containing personal information, a nested `Date` structure for date of birth, and an array to store marks.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a nested `Date` structure for the day, month, and year.  
- Defines a `Student` structure including ID, name, nested `Date` of birth, and an array of marks.  
- Assigns and prints data for a single student and an array of students.  
- Uses a function with a pointer parameter to print student details.  
- Illustrates structured data management and array initialization within structures.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Nested structures and array members in C structs  
- String copying with `strcpy` for struct members  
- Passing structs to functions via pointers  
- Loops for array initialization and printing
