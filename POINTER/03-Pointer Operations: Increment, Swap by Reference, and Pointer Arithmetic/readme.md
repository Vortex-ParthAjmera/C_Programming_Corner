## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates key pointer operations including:  
- Incrementing an integer via pointer dereferencing  
- Swapping two integers using call by reference with pointers  
- Accessing array elements using pointer arithmetic

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- `increment` function that increments an integer through its pointer.  
- `swap` function that swaps two integers by passing their addresses to modify original variables.  
- Example of pointer arithmetic by traversing and printing elements of an integer array using pointer offsets.  
- Demonstrates pointer dereferencing, address passing, and basic array traversal using pointers.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Pointer dereferencing for value manipulation  
- Call by reference in C using pointers  
- Pointer arithmetic for array access  
- Input/output formatting and variable state tracking
