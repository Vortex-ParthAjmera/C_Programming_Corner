## 📘 Description  
Program steps:  
- Reads the number of rows for the pyramid pattern.  
- Displays a menu to choose between normal and inverted pyramid patterns.  
- Uses nested loops to print spaces and stars to form the pyramids.  
- Handles invalid choices with an error message.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Nested loops for space and star printing  
- Use of `switch`-`case` for conditional control flow  
- Formatted console output  
- User input validation and handling
