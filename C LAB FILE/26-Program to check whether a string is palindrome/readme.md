## 📄 Overview  
This C program checks if a given string is a palindrome.  
It reads a string, removes any trailing newline, and compares characters from both ends to determine if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program flow includes:  
- Reading a string input using `fgets()`.  
- Removing the newline character from the input string if present.  
- Using the `isPalindrome` function to check if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from start and end moving towards the center.  
- Printing the result of the palindrome check.

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- String traversal and indexing  
- Character comparison for palindrome logic  
- Input handling and newline removal  
- Loop and condition usage for string validation
