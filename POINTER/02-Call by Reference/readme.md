## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates swapping two integer values using a function with call by reference.  
By passing pointers to the variables, the swap modifies the original values.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a function `swapByReference` that takes integer pointers and swaps values at those addresses.  
- Prints the swapped values inside the function to verify changes.  
- The `main` function prints values before and after calling the swap function, confirming the original variables are modified.  
- Illustrates the concept of call by reference using pointers.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Pointers for address referencing  
- Dereferencing to modify original variables  
- Function parameter passing via pointers  
- Difference between call by value and call by reference
