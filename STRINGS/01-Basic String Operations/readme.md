## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates the use of various common string handling functions from the C standard library.  
It covers length calculation, copying, concatenation, comparison, searching, and memory manipulation functions.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Uses `strlen` to get string length.  
- Demonstrates string copying with `strcpy` and `strncpy`.  
- Shows string concatenation using `strcat` and `strncat`.  
- Compares strings with `strcmp` and `strncmp`.  
- Finds characters and substrings in strings using `strchr`, `strrchr`, and `strstr`.  
- Manipulates memory contents within strings using `memset`, `memcpy`, and compares memory using `memcmp`.  
- Prints results to illustrate how each function works and what effects they produce.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Using C string library functions for effective string manipulation  
- Handling string termination and buffer limits carefully  
- Differentiating between string- and memory-based functions  
- Index calculations for substring and character search results
