## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the size of the array and its elements from the user.  
- Calculates the midpoint, handling both even and odd sizes correctly.  
- Uses a temporary array to store and reorder elements by swapping halves.  
- Prints the resulting array after swapping.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Array manipulation and temporary storage  
- Index arithmetic for splitting and combining array halves  
- Handling edge cases for even and odd-sized arrays  
- User interaction and formatted output
