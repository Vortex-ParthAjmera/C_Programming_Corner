## 📄 Overview  
This C program counts and prints the even and odd numbers from a user-input array of integers.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the number of elements and then the array values from the user.  
- Iterates through the array to identify and print even numbers, counting them as it goes.  
- Similarly, iterates to identify and print odd numbers and counts them.  
- Displays the total counts of even and odd numbers separately.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Array handling and iteration  
- Conditional checking for parity using modulus operator  
- Counting and output formatting with loops and conditions  
- User input and output via standard functions `scanf()` and `printf()`
