## 📄 Overview  
This C program provides two functionalities:  
1. Calculate the factorial of a specific number.  
2. Print the factorial series up to a given number.

The user selects the desired option, and the program computes factorial values using an iterative function.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Prompts the user to choose between factorial calculation and factorial series printing.  
- Reads user input for the number (or limit) and validates that it is non-negative.  
- Uses a reusable `factorial` function that calculates factorials iteratively.  
- Displays factorial results with clear formatting.  
- Handles invalid choices gracefully.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Modular function design for reusability  
- Switch-case control flow for menu-based interaction  
- Looping constructs for series generation  
- Input validation and user communication
