## 📄 Overview  
This C program reverses the digits of an integer entered by the user.  
It extracts digits sequentially and rebuilds the number in reverse order.

## 📘 Description  
The program accomplishes the following:  
- Prompts the user to input an integer.  
- Uses a `while` loop to extract each digit using modulus `%` and rebuilds the reversed number.  
- Demonstrates the use of conditional statements, including a trivial if-else block for demonstration purposes.  
- Prints the reversed number as output.

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Looping and digit extraction using arithmetic operators  
- Conditional branching with `if-else` statements  
- User interaction through `printf()` and `scanf()`
