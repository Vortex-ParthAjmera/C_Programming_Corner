## 📄 Overview  
This C program traverses a matrix in spiral order with two traversal modes:  
**Standard Clockwise** and **Modified Spiral Pattern**.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- **Standard Spiral**: Traverses matrix clockwise in layers (outer → inner).  
- **Modified Spiral**: Special pattern with center elements printed in clockwise order.  
- Uses boundary pointers (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to track current layer.  
- Menu-driven selection between traversal modes.  
- Displays original matrix and traversal result.  
- Includes explanation of pattern differences.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Four-directional matrix traversal logic  
- Boundary pointer technique for layer processing  
- Conditional loop control for matrix dimensions  
- Menu-driven program with function modularity  
- Algorithmic pattern recognition and implementation
