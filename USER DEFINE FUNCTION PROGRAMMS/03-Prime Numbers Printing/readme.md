## 📄 Overview  
This C program prints all prime numbers up to a user-specified limit.  
It uses a helper function to check primality and iterates through the range to display all primes.

## 📘 Description  
Program components:  
- `isPrime`: Determines if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root.  
- `printPrimes`: Iterates from 2 to the limit and prints numbers verified as prime.  
- The `main` function collects user input and calls `printPrimes`.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Efficient prime checking using square root logic  
- Modular function design and usage  
- Looping constructs for iteration  
- Input handling and formatted output
