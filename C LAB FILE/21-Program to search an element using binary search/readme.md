## 📄 Overview  
This C program performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a specified element.  
It efficiently halves the searchable area each iteration until the element is found or the search space is exhausted.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program follows these steps:  
- Prompts the user to enter the number of sorted elements and validates the input.  
- Reads the sorted integer array elements from the user.  
- Prompts for the search key.  
- Uses the `binary_search` function to iteratively locate the key, returning its index or -1 if not found.  
- Displays the result with position (1-based) and zero-based index if found, or a not-found message otherwise.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Binary search algorithm implementation  
- Efficient searching on sorted arrays  
- Looping and conditional statements  
- Validated input and formatted output
