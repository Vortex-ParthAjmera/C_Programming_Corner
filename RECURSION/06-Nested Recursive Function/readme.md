## 📄 Overview  
This C program implements a nested recursive function similar to the McCarthy 100 function.  
It computes a value with recursive calls until the input surpasses a threshold.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a function `fun(int n)` that:  
  - Returns `n - 5` if `n` is greater than 100.  
  - Otherwise recursively calls `fun` twice with `n + 11`.  
- Demonstrates the power and flow of nested recursion.  
- Initial call made with input `45` and the final result is printed.  
- Showcases how recursion can converge and reduce complex expressions.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Nested recursive calls  
- Recursive depth and condition handling  
- Understanding function call stacks with recursion
