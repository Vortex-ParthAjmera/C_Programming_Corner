## 📄 Overview  
This C program captures and displays student information using a `struct`.  
It reads input for student ID, name, age, and marks, and then prints the details formatted.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program steps include:  
- Defining a `Student` structure with fields for ID, name, age, and marks.  
- Reading student details from the user, including handling input buffer clearing before reading strings.  
- Removing newline characters from the input name string.  
- Displaying all student details neatly formatted.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Use of structures to group related data  
- Input handling, including clearing input buffer and reading strings safely with `fgets()`  
- String newline trimming  
- Formatted output using `printf()`
