## 📄 Overview  
This C program performs a linear search to find a specified element within an array.  
It returns the index of the element if found, or indicates if the element is not present.

## 📘 Description  
The program execution flow:  
- Prompts the user to enter the number of elements and validates the input.  
- Reads the array elements from user input.  
- Prompts for the search key.  
- Uses the `linear_search` function to scan for the key and returns its index or -1 if absent.  
- Displays the search result, including index and position (1-based).

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Array traversal and element comparison  
- Function implementation for search with return values  
- Simple input validation and user prompts  
- Output formatting with index and position details
