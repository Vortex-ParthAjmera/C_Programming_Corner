## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Defines a `Book` struct with ID, title, and price fields.  
- Inputs number of books and their details from the user with newline-safe string input.  
- Uses bubble sort to order books by price in ascending order.  
- Displays the sorted list in a neatly formatted table with column headings.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Structs and arrays of structs for structured data management  
- Safe string input handling with `fgets` and newline removal  
- Implementation of bubble sort for custom data types  
- Formatted console output for tabular display  
- Handling input buffers with `getchar()` for mixed input types
