## 📄 Overview  
This C program provides a menu-driven interface to perform various string operations including length calculation, copying, concatenation, comparison, and counting vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Custom implementations of string functions:  
  - `stringLength`: calculates the length of a string without using built-in functions.  
  - `stringCopy`: copies one string into another.  
  - `stringConcat`: concatenates two strings.  
  - `stringCompare`: compares two strings lexicographically.  
- Counts character types in a string, including vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces.  
- Handles user input safely using `fgets` and removes trailing newlines appropriately.  
- Provides a clear menu for interactive operations and validates user choices.  
- Demonstrates fundamental string manipulation and pointer usage in C.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Manual string handling without standard library reliance  
- Pointer and array manipulation  
- Input sanitization and handling multi-line input  
- Conditional logic and menu-driven program design
