## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user.  
It implements input validation and handles different cases for negative numbers, zero, and positive integers.

## 📘 Description  
The program performs these tasks:  
- Prompts the user to enter an integer value.  
- Checks if the entered number is negative, zero, or positive.  
- For negative inputs, it displays an error message since factorials are not defined for negative numbers.  
- For zero, it reports that the factorial is 1.  
- For positive numbers, it uses a `while` loop to compute the factorial by multiplying numbers from 1 to the entered value.  

Key topics covered:  
- Input/output using `printf()` and `scanf()`  
- Input validation with `if–else` conditional statements  
- Iterative computation using a `while` loop  
- Working with large numbers via the `unsigned long long` data type
