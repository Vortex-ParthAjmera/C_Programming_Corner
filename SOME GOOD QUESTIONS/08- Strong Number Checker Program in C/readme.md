## 📄 Overview  
This C program checks if a given number is a "Strong Number."  
A Strong Number is one where the sum of the factorials of its digits equals the original number.

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Implements an iterative `factorial` function to compute factorial of each digit.  
- Extracts digits using modulo and division operations.  
- Accumulates the sum of factorials of all digits.  
- Compares the sum with the original number to verify if it's a Strong Number.  
- Handles the complete workflow from input to result display.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Iterative factorial calculation  
- Digit extraction using arithmetic operations  
- Variable preservation (`onum` for original number)  
- Conditional result checking and formatted output
