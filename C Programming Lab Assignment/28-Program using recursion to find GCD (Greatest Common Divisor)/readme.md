## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using recursion.  
It implements the Euclidean algorithm efficiently through a recursive function.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program flow includes:  
- Reading two integers from the user.  
- Using a recursive `gcd` function which:  
  - Returns the first number if the second is zero.  
  - Otherwise, recursively calls itself with the second number and the remainder of the first divided by the second.  
- Prints the computed GCD.

Key concepts demonstrated:  
- Recursion with base and recursive cases  
- Efficient implementation of the Euclidean algorithm  
- Simple input and output handling via `scanf()` and `printf()`
