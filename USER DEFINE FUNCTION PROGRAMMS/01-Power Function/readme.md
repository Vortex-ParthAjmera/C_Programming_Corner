## 📄 Overview  
This C program computes the power of a base raised to a non-negative exponent using an iterative approach.  
It repeatedly multiplies the base for the given exponent count.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program details:  
- Prompts the user to enter the base and exponent values.  
- Implements a `power` function that multiplies the base by itself exponent times in a loop.  
- Returns and prints the computed power result.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Using loops for repeated multiplication  
- Function definition and return values  
- User input and output handling with `scanf()` and `printf()`
