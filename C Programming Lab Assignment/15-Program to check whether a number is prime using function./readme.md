## 📄 Overview  
This C program determines whether a given number is prime or not.  
It uses an efficient method by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

## 📘 Description  
The program workflow:  
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.  
- Implements the `prime` function which returns 1 if the number is prime, 0 otherwise.  
- The `prime` function:  
  - Returns 0 for numbers less than or equal to 1 (not prime).  
  - Uses a loop to test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.  
- Prints whether the number is prime based on the function’s result.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Prime number logic with optimized checking  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Function definition and return values  
- Input/output handling through `scanf()` and `printf()`
