## 📄 Overview  
This C program calculates the sums of the main (primary) and anti (secondary) diagonals of a square matrix.

---

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the order and elements of a square matrix from the user.  
- Computes the sum of the main diagonal elements where row index equals column index.  
- Computes the sum of the anti-diagonal elements where column index is `n - 1 - row index`.  
- Outputs both sums clearly.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Two-dimensional array traversal  
- Index calculation for diagonal elements  
- Accumulation of sums using loops  
- Formatted console output
