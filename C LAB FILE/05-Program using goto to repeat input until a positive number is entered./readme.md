## 📄 Overview  
This C program demonstrates the use of the `goto` statement to repeat user input until a valid (positive) number is entered.  
It ensures that only positive values are accepted by re-prompting the user if an invalid input is given.

## 📘 Description  
The program performs the following tasks:  
- Prompts the user to enter a number.  
- Checks whether the number entered is positive.  
- If the number is non-positive (zero or negative), it displays an error message and jumps back to the input section using the `goto` statement.  
- Once a positive number is entered, it confirms the valid input and exits successfully.

Key concepts covered:  
- Input validation using conditional statements  
- Use of label and `goto` for control flow  
- Displaying user guidance messages using `printf()` and receiving input via `scanf()`
