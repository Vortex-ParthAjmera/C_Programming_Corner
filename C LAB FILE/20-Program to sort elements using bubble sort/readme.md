## 📄 Overview  
This C program sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.  
Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, resulting in a sorted array.

---

## 📘 Description  
The program flow:  
- Reads the number of elements from the user with validation.  
- Accepts input elements for the array.  
- Calls the `bubble_sort` function which implements Bubble Sort to sort the array in ascending order.  
- Prints the sorted array elements space-separated.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Nested loops and array manipulation  
- Swap operations to reorder elements  
- Input validation and output formatting
