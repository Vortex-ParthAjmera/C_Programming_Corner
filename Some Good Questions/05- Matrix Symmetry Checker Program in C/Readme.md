## 📄 Overview  
This C program checks whether a given square matrix is symmetric or not.  
A matrix is symmetric if it equals its own transpose (`arr[i][j] == arr[j][i]`).

## 📘 Description  
Program features:  
- Reads the size of a square matrix from the user.  
- Accepts all matrix elements using nested loops.  
- Compares each element `arr[i][j]` with `arr[j][i]` to verify symmetry.  
- Uses a flag variable to track symmetry status.  
- Prints whether the matrix is symmetric or not.

Key programming concepts demonstrated:  
- Two-dimensional array (matrix) handling  
- Nested loops for matrix input and traversal  
- Matrix transpose property verification  
- Flag-based conditional logic  
- Efficient early termination on asymmetry detection
